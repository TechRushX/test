= The Frankfurt Negotiations

# reference: Evans, Ellen L. “Adam Stegerwald and the Role of the Christian Trade Unions in the Weimar Republic.” The Catholic Historical Review 59, no. 4 (1974): 602–26.

Due to the rise of polarization in German politics, we have reached out to our Weimar partners, the Center and the DDP, to conclude several electoral truces to prevent the rise of the far right and far left in local elections.

They have thrown around some skepticism, no doubt about that - president Hindenburg in particular has shown a negative sentiment towards our efforts, criticizing the bourgeoisie of cozying up to socialists. The leftists have also shown their distress over cooperation: epsecially with Z. They warn that they will heavily protest if so.

In the end, a possible agreement was reached with Strassman, who agreed to the plan fully. However, Bruning has shown reservations, demanding that his cooperation in this would require financial support for elections too.

This will slightly downgrade our perception amongst others, but also increase our new middle class support. The more radical we choose, the more radical the effects will be, too.

- @minor_agreement: Collaborate only with the DDP.
- @major_agreement: We must display Weimar unity!
- @no_agreement: Our party won't stand for this.

on-arrival: z_relation -= 5; workers_spd -= 3; new_middle_spd += 5; ddp_relation += 10; pro_republic += 3; left_dissent += 4

We have succesfully reached an understanding with Stressman. Zentrum is slightly upset at our decision to not grant them concessions, though. Nontheless, faith in our republic is renewed, and our DDP relations stand to gain with it.

@major_agreement
unavailable-subtitle: We do not have enough resources.
subtitle: -1 resource. This will have the most radical effects.

on-arrival: z_relation += 10; ddp_relation += 10; workers_spd -= 5; new_middle_spd += 8; pro_republic += 5; left_dissent +=10

Weimar stands united once again! Our worker support is somewhat shaken due to cooperation with the center-right, whilst our reputation amongst the new middle class is better than ever. Support for the republic has greatly increased, and so do our relations with our renewed partners. The left is in uproar.

@no_agreement
subtitle: The workers will applaud us for not caving in to the burgeouisie!
on-arrival: z_relation -= 10; ddp_relation -= 10; workers_spd += 4; left_dissent -=10; left_strength += 10

We have concluded negotiations, and we decided not to pursue further cooperation. Center and DDP express their condemnations for this waste of time and effort, but we make up for it with new support from workers. The left is pleased, and is now an even stronger faction than before.
