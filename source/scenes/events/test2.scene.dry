= The Frankfurt Negotiations

# reference: Evans, Ellen L. “Adam Stegerwald and the Role of the Christian Trade Unions in the Weimar Republic.” The Catholic Historical Review 59, no. 4 (1974): 602–26.

The rise of both the Far-Right and the Far-Left has compelled even the Labour faction in our party to consider more negotiations with the Center and DDP in order to prevent their ascension to power - in local elections, at least. The Left have expressed their objections, arguing that our current cooperation levels with the bourgeioise are more than enough already.

As such, they have proposed meeting in Farnkfurt with Bruning and Stressman to develop, negotiate and implement several actions meant to keep Germany democracy alive.

We are expected to lead the conference, so naturally, to finance it too.

We will meet with our Weimar partners! Discussions will more than lkely wrap around the beginning of next year. The left have grown in strength, succesfuly presenting these negotiations as mere ploys meant to delay the inevitable revolution of the proletariat.

@no_meet
on-arrival: left_dissent -= 10; labor_dissent += 10; reformist_dissent += 10; pro_republic -=3

We have rejected the negotiation proposals. The Left shows their gratituge, whilst the labor and reformist wings accuse us of inaction in the face of an exisential threat towards Germany. The far-right uses this as an opportunity to show the weakness in our republic, shaking the public's belief quite a bit.
